Small companion app that feeds SoundVitrine with ITunes / Music library metadata !

## How to build and debug

Available for MacOS (BigSur 11.0+) and Windows 10+. Usage of Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com) as IDE is recommanded.
Requires a C++20 enabled compiler. We assume you have Git installed on your system.

- Run command in terminal to clone this repository: `git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/Amphaal/SoundBuddy`
- In VS Code, use the command palette to run `Tasks : Run Tests Task`, which will configure the build
- In VS Code, simply run `Launch` in the `Execute and Debug` tab to build the executable 

SoundBuddy have some dependencies that are external and thus need to be installed on your system. Here is how to proceed on each handled platform :

### MacOS (LLVMClang)

#### Dependencies
All dependencies are fetched via Homebrew (https://brew.sh), make sure you have it properly installed on your build system.
- Run command in terminal to fetch depedencies : `brew install $(cat ./prerequisites/brew.txt)`

#### Security
Now from OSX 13.2+, executables have to be signed with a developper identity to be even lauched (for Qt binary depedencies via `macdeployqt`, for IFW OSX Bundle via `CPack`...).
You need a locally registered XCode / Apple developper platform linked to your XCode app, and then set `APPLE_CODESIGN_ID` and `APPLE_CERT_APP_CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY` env variables:
They would look like:
- APPLE_CODESIGN_ID=U2T7J2AC52
- APPLE_CERT_APP_CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="Apple Development: Guillaume VARA (U2T7J2AC52)"

### Windows (MSYS MinGW)

#### Dependencies
We use MSYS2 build system (https://www.msys2.org) as our build platform. Make sure to install it if it is not.
- Define `MINGW64_ROOT` as environment variable, as the path of MinGW64 installed by MSYS2 (Ex: `C:\msys2\mingw64`).
- From VS Code, use the `Msys2 Shell` terminal to run the following commands.
- Run command in terminal to update obsolete packages : `pacman -Syyu`
- Run command in terminal to fetch depedencies : `pacman -S --needed - < ./prerequisites/msys.txt`

#### Security
On Windows, if installer is not signed, Chrome + Windows Defender will ring alarms all over the place.

- Download required Windows App Certification App via Windows SDK Setup (`mingw-w64-x86_64-nss` does not seems to work atm): https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=698771
